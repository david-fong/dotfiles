		<div>Note that if you want me to get an inbox notification for your messages in here, you'll need to include "@starball" in your message, which happens automatically when you use the message reply feature by clicking the arrow button on one of my messages.</div>
		<div>Please remove the "+1" comments.</div>
		<div>please expand. https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/8259/997587</div>
		<div>any affiliation? [/help/promotion](/help/promotion) also, please show how to use it to solve the problem in the question.</div>
		<div>how is this a [non-answer](//meta.stackoverflow.com/a/265553/11107541)?</div>
		<div>note: if you think a question needs more detail/clarity, you are discouraged from answering it until that detail/clarity is added. see [answer].</div>

		<div>I suggest that you give that issue ticket a thumbs up to show support for it. You can also subscribe to it to get notified about discussion and progress. Please avoid making noisy comments there like ones that just consist of "+1" / "bump".</div>
		<div>If anyone reading this ends up raising an issue ticket like I suggested, please either comment here with the link to it, or notify me in it with "@starball5" and a link to this Stack Overflow post so I can update it.</div>
		<div>now that you've done that, the feature request needs to get enough community support to be added to the backlog. this is time sensitive. there's a 60 day window to get 20 thumbs up reactions on the issue ticket. I'd suggest sharing this issue ticket with your developer friends / colleagues and asking them to give it a thumbs up if they would also like to see this implemented. sharing on [r/vscode](https://reddit.com/r/vscode) is also an option.</div>
		<div>People, please stop making comments that just consist of "+1" and similar. Read the rules in https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/wiki/Submitting-Bugs-and-Suggestions. If you want to say "+1", give the first comment in this issue ticket a thumbs up. _That's_ what the maintainers look at to guide what they prioritize. You writing "+1" comments just spams the inboxes of people who want to get pings about actual meaningful discussion or progress related to the issue.</div>
		<div>It appears this post was in whole or in part created with AI tools. Please note that [it is not permitted to use AI tools](//meta.stackoverflow.com/q/421831/11107541) to generate or reword content that you post on Stack Overflow, even if you vet this content beforehand. See also the [Help Center: AI policy](/help/ai-policy) for further information. We do hope you'll stick around and become a valuable member of the community by contributing your own quality answers and questions in the future!</div>
		<div>You should decide if you want help fixing your code, or if you want to just provide a skeleton that does no animation, and ask people to add the animation functionality. in other words, you do not have to provide a failing attempt to ask how to do something (though others may tell you otherwise- [just ignore them](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/260909/11107541)). I _personally_ believe that for "how to" questions, a failing attempt is usually not useful to future readers. you can make your own choice. if you are happy with providing a failing attempt, just make a minor edit and publish.</div>
		<div>Please read [/help/dont-ask](/help/dont-ask). the scale/scope of this question is very large and I think I can confidently say too large for a single Q&A on Stack Overflow. You're going to need to break this into many smaller scoped questions- starting by editing this one. I suggest also to check first if those smaller questions have been asked already. If you'd like to ask a highly opinionated question, take a look at https://stackoverflow.com/beta/discussions.</div>
